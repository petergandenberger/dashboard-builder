The dashboard-builder is still in development. If you have any questions or feedback please don't hesitate to reach out to me via email or github.

## pre-requisits
To run the dashboard-builder and any exported dashboards you need to install the gridstackeR package
``` r
devtools::install_github("https://github.com/petergandenberger/gridstackeR")
```

## Demo
There is a [demo available online](https://pega.shinyapps.io/dashboard-builder/)

## Workflow
There are four steps in creating shiny apps with the dashboard builder

1. Import data
2. Create Elements
3. Export the Dashboard
4. Improve and Extend

## More
Please have a look at [my talk at rstudio::conf(2022) introducing the dashboard-builder](https://sched.co/11ibG)
